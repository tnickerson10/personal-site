                Growing up my father taught me the importance of being able to build things myself. Over time,
                there was a sense of self pride that came with being able to imagine something and then build 
                what it is I imagined. This quickly turned into a love of woodworking to express that creativity.

                Growing up in San Diego, Ca. there was no shortage of things to do and adventures that were close by. I loved
                to surf, go fishing and anything that had to do with being outside. Family time was spent at the beach and the 
                lakes. As I grew up I ventured further away enjoying backpacking trips in the Sierras and the Desert.

                time growing my skills personally. I have trained in Jiu-Jitsu and wrestled along with more recently taken

                Becoming a father was one of the greatest and proudest moments of my life. It truly has made me look
                at life in a new way. Being able to pass down life lessons and experience to my son as he grows will
                continue to be the best parts of my life.

            <p>
                Programming has become one of the most recent passions of mine. I have always loved creativity and building
                things, but it never crossed my mind that I could do both of those things with computers. It has challenged
                me in a complete new way and I love it.

            <p>
                Both of my parents instilled in me the power of knowledge and to be a forever learner. As I have become older
                I have found that I truly love to learn. I love documentaries, reading and recently fell in love with podcasts
                and audiobooks.
